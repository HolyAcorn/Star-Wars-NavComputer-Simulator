When choosing a starting location it will check if the starting location is a planet.

If STarting Location is NOT a planet or if planet is not connected to a hyperspace route, 
	it will search around itself untill it finds a planet connected to a hyperspace route, from there, 
	it will search for the planet through hyperspace routes.

If starting location is a planet that is connected to a hyperspace route
	it will search for the planet through hyperspace routes.


If target location is Not on hyperspace route
	it will look at the hyperspace connected planet closest to it, and calculate travel through there.
